# Asterinas OSTD API documentation

This repository hosts the self-generated API documentation for the OSTD crate of the Asterinas project.
The OSTD crate is published on crates.io. However, since the official Rust documentation site, doc.rs, always uses the latest Rust toolchain to render API docs—which may sometimes be incompatible with the toolchain used by Asterinas—we have chosen to host the API documentation here.
